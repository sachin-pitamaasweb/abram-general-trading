      instructions: `
        To prepare a flavorful veg pulao, start by cooking the rice. Boil 2 cups of water in a pan, add the soaked 
        basmati rice, salt, and a teaspoon of oil or ghee. Cook the rice until it is 90% done, ensuring the grains 
        remain firm and not mushy. Drain any excess water and set the rice aside to cool. Meanwhile, heat ghee or 
        oil in a large pan over medium heat and add cumin seeds, bay leaf, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, and 
        peppercorns, sautéing for about 30 seconds until aromatic. Next, add thinly sliced onions and cook until 
        golden brown, followed by slit green chilies and ginger-garlic paste, sautéing until the raw aroma disappears.

         Add the mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, capsicum, and cauliflower) and cashews, stirring well and frying 
        for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables soften slightly. Sprinkle turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt, mixing 
        everything thoroughly. Gently fold in the cooked rice, being careful not to break the grains. Cover the pan and 
        let the pulao cook on low heat for about 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Finally, garnish the 
        pulao with freshly chopped coriander leaves and a drizzle of lemon juice. Serve hot with raita, pickle, or a 
        curry of your choice for a wholesome and delicious meal.
